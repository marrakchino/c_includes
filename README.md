# c_includes
Insert common C includes to your file's header

## TODO

This is the very beginning of this Vim script. As I couldn't easily find a 
similar project online, I quickly jotted down these few lines to ease my normal C 
development/testing flow. Here are a few things I wish to do soon:

* Make the `g:c_libraries` list more exhaustive by adding less common libraries 
(time, ctypes, etc.)

* Prompt the user to choose which library he wishes to include

* Check if the library is already included before appending the `#include`
